# Arkson - Bio

Arkson emerged out of Toronto, Canada in early 2015, a personal side project of musician David Park, with the goal of recording and releasing a collection of songs Park had been working on. With the expertise and mentorship of Steve Worrall, producer and former touring musician with Tom Cochrane, Park began recording.

After producing and releasing a new song and video every month from January through May of 2015, Arkson released the White Lines EP in June, a collection of the songs from the past months. The White Lines EP was rooted in alternative rock, and developed a full sound with the careful crafting of it's songs. The EP was distributed, and the production of CDs funded through a successful Kickstarter campaign.

A summer of hard work and reinvention led to 'a new era' for Arkson, releasing the Storm EP in November 2015, and perfecting the process of the White Lines EP before it. Again releasing a new song and video every month in the fall of 2015, the Storm EP was released November 30, exactly 5 months after it's predecessor, and was recorded entirely by Park at his home studio, and mixed by Danny Mucci. The EP featured a darker and more organic sound, using imagery of a storm throughout it and to it's culmination in the final track, a soundscape made to recreate the experience of the thunderstorm. Still though, Arkson remained true to the full alternative rock sound the band had grown on.

2015 brought about the sound of Arkson, with the release of two EPs and an introduction on social media. 2016, on the other hand, has brought about the face of Arkson. The band currently plays as a 7 piece act - piano, bass, drums, a second guitar and a two man horn section in addition to Park's leading vocals and guitar. The band has played different shows in Toronto, and is expected to play at the 2016 StArt Festival, a celebration of Scarborough Arts.
